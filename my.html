    <h1>About ME</h1>


    <p>My name is A. Balasaravanan, and I am a student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at SRM Valliammai Engineering College. I come from Ambasamudram, a town in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. I have developed a strong interest in web development and have already learned the basics of HTML. I am currently eager to expand my skills by learning CSS and JavaScript. With a passion for creating interactive and visually appealing websites, my career goal is to become a professional web developer in the near future.</p>
